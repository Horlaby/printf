# printf

_This simple printf task is created by Yushau Babatunde and Isah medinat for ALX Software Engineering School.


# Welcome 

We are to rebuild the standard printf function in C. This project requires a function that is capable of printing the %d, %c, %s, %% specifiers to the stdio. Printf  returs the number of character printed.

# Format Specifiers

We choose to add %x ,%X, %b, %o, %u, %r, %R, and %p formatting by relying on the library we have been building at Alx as well as new concepts gathered during this project.
